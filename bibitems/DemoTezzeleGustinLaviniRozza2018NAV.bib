    abstract = {Shape optimization is a challenging task in many engineering
        fields, since the numerical solutions of parametric system may be
        computationally expensive. This work presents a novel optimization
        procedure based on reduced order modeling, applied to a naval hull
        design problem. The advantage introduced by this method is that the
        solution for a specific parameter can be expressed as the combination
        of few numerical solutions computed at properly chosen parametric
        points. The reduced model is built using the proper orthogonal
        decomposition with interpolation (PODI) method. We use the free form
        deformation (FFD) for an automated perturbation of the shape, and the
        finite volume method to simulate the multiphase incompressible flow
        around the deformed hulls. Further computational reduction is done by
        the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) technique: from few high
        dimensional snapshots, the system evolution is reconstructed and the
        final state of the simulation is faithfully approximated. Finally the
        global optimization algorithm iterates over the reduced space: the
        approximated drag and lift coefficients are projected to the hull
        surface, hence the resistance is evaluated for the new hulls until the
        convergence to the optimal shape is achieved. We will present the
        results obtained applying the described procedure to a typical
        Fincantieri cruise ship}

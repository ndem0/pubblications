  abstract = {Reduced order modeling (ROM) provides an efficient framework to
	      compute solutions of parametric problems. Basically, it exploits
	      a set of precomputed high-fidelity solutions --- computed for
	      properly chosen parameters, using a full-order model --- in order
	      to find the low dimensional space that contains the solution
	      manifold. Using this space, an approximation of the numerical
	      solution for new parameters can be computed in real-time response
	      scenario, thanks to the reduced dimensionality of the problem. In
	      a ROM framework, the most expensive part from the computational
	      viewpoint is the calculation of the numerical solutions using the
	      full-order model. Of course, the number of collected solutions is
	      strictly related to the accuracy of the reduced order model. In
	      this work, we aim at increasing the precision of the model also
	      for few input solutions by coupling the proper orthogonal
	      decomposition with interpolation (PODI) --- a data-driven reduced
	      order method --- with the active subspace (AS) property, an
	      emerging tool for reduction in parameter space. The enhanced ROM
	      results in a reduced number of input solutions to reach the
	      desired accuracy. In this contribution, we present the numerical
	      results obtained by applying this method to a structural problem
	      and in a fluid dynamics one.},

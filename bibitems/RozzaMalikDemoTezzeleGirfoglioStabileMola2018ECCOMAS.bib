	Abstract = {Reduced order modeling has gained considerable attention in recent decades
owing to the advantages offered in reduced computational times and multiple solutions
for parametric problems.  The focus of this manuscript is the application of model order
reduction techniques in various engineering and scientific applications including but not
limited to mechanical, naval and aeronautical engineering.  The focus here is kept limited
to computational fluid mechanics and related applications.  The advances in the reduced
order modeling with proper orthogonal decomposition and reduced basis method are presented as well as a brief discussion of dynamic mode decomposition and also some present
advances in the parameter space reduction.  Here, an overview of the challenges faced and
possible solutions are presented with examples from various problems.}

    abstract = {Current development trends of fast processors calls for an increasing number of cores, each core featuring wide vector processing units. Applications must then exploit both directions of parallelism to run efficiently. In this work we focus on the efficient use of vector instructions. These process several data-elements in parallel, and memory data layout plays an important role to make this efficient. An optimal memory-layout depends in principle on the access patterns of the algorithm but also on the architectural features of the processor. However, different parts of the application may have different requirements, and then the choice of the most efficient data-structure for vectorization has to be carefully assessed. We address these problems for a Lattice Boltzmann (LB) code, widely used in computational fluid-dynamics. We consider a state-of-the-art two-dimensional LB model, that accurately reproduces the thermo-hydrodynamics of a 2D-fluid. We write our codes in C and expose vector parallelism using directive-based programming approach. We consider different data layouts and analyze the corresponding performance. Our results show that, if an appropriate data layout is selected, it is possible to write a code for this class of applications that is automatically vectorized and performance portable on several architectures. We end up with a single code that runs efficiently onto traditional multi-core processors as well as on recent many-core systems such as the Xeon-Phi.},

    abstract = {Shape optimization is a challenging task in many engineering
        fields, since the numerical solutions of parametric system may be
        computationally expensive. This work presents a novel optimization
        procedure based on reduced order modeling, applied to a naval hull
        design problem. The advantage introduced by this method is that the
        solution for a specific parameter can be expressed as the combination
        of few numerical solutions computed at properly chosen parametric
        points. The reduced model is built using the proper orthogonal
        decomposition with interpolation (PODI) method. We use the free form
        deformation (FFD) for an automated perturbation of the shape, and the
        finite volume method to simulate the multiphase incompressible flow
        around the deformed hulls. Further computational reduction is done by
        the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) technique: from few high
        dimensional snapshots, the system evolution is reconstructed and the
        final state of the simulation is faithfully approximated. Finally the
        global optimization algorithm iterates over the reduced space: the
        approximated drag and lift coefficients are projected to the hull
        surface, hence the resistance is evaluated for the new hulls until the
        convergence to the optimal shape is achieved. We will present the
        results obtained applying the described procedure to a typical
        Fincantieri cruise ship}

    abstract = {In this contribution, we present the results of the application
        of a parameter space reduction methodology based on active subspaces to
        the hull hydrodynamic design problem. Several parametric deformations
        of an initial hull shape are considered to assess the influence of the
        shape parameters considered on the hull total drag. The hull resistance
        is typically computed by means of numerical simulations of the
        hydrodynamic flow past the ship. Given the high number of parameters
        involved - which might result in a high number of time consuming
        hydrodynamic simulations - assessing whether the parameters space can
        be reduced would lead to considerable computational cost reduction.
        Thus, the main idea of this work is to employ the active subspaces to
        identify possible lower dimensional structures in the parameter space,
        or to verify the parameter distribution in the position of the control
        points.  To this end, a fully automated procedure has been implemented
        to produce several small shape perturbations of an original hull CAD
        geometry which are then used to carry out high-fidelity flow
        simulations and collect data for the active subspaces analysis. To
        achieve full automation of the open source pipeline described, both the
        free form deformation methodology employed for the hull perturbations
        and the solver based on unsteady potential flow theory, with fully
        nonlinear free surface treatment, are directly interfaced with CAD data
        structures and operate using IGES vendor-neutral file formats as input
        files. The computational cost of the fluid dynamic simulations is
        further reduced through the application of dynamic mode decomposition
        to reconstruct the steady state total drag value given only few initial
        snapshots of the simulation. The active subspaces analysis is here
        applied to the geometry of the DTMB-5415 naval combatant hull, which is
        which is a common benchmark in ship hydrodynamics simulations.}

    abstract = {In the reduced order modeling (ROM) framework, the solution of a parametric partial differential equation is approximated by combining the high-fidelity solutions of the problem at hand for several properly chosen configurations. Examples of the ROM application, in the naval field, can be found in [31, 24]. Mandatory ingredient for the ROM methods is the relation between the high-fidelity solutions and the parameters. Dealing with geometrical parameters, especially in the industrial context, this relation may be unknown and not trivial (simulations over hand morphed geometries) or very complex (high number of parameters or many nested morphing techniques). To overcome these scenarios, we propose in this contribution an efficient and complete data-driven framework involving ROM techniques for shape design and optimization, extending the pipeline presented in [7]. By applying the singular value decomposition (SVD) to the points coordinates defining the hull geometry --- assuming the topology is inaltered by the deformation ---, we are able to compute the optimal space which the deformed geometries belong to, hence using the modal coefficients as the new parameters we can reconstruct the parametric formulation of the domain. Finally the output of interest is approximated using the proper orthogonal decomposition with interpolation technique. To conclude, we apply this framework to a naval shape design problem where the bulbous bow is morphed to reduce the total resistance of the ship advancing in calm water.}

Such methods are proper orthogonal decomposition with interpolation (PODI) and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). The ROM proposed will be enhanced by active subspaces (AS) as a pre-processing tool that reduce the parameter space dimension and suggest better sampling of the input space. We will focus on geometrical parameters describing the perturbation of a reference bulbous bow through the free form deformation (FFD) technique. The ROM are based on a finite volume method (FV) to simulate the multi-phase incompressible flow around the deformed hulls. In previous works we studied the reduction of the parameter space in naval engineering through AS [38, 10] focusing on different parts of the hull. PODI and DMD have been employed for the study of fast and reliable shape optimization cycles on a bulbous bow in [9]. The novelty of this work is the simultaneous reduction of both the input parameter space and the output fields of interest. In particular AS will be trained computing the total drag resistance of a hull advancing in calm water and its gradients with respect to the input parameters. DMD will improve the performance of each simulation of the campaign using only few snapshots of the solution fields in order to predict the regime state of the system. Finally PODI will interpolate the coefficients of the POD decomposition of the output fields for a fast approximation of all the fields at new untried parameters given by the optimization algorithm. This will result in a non-intrusive data-driven numerical optimization pipeline completely independent with respect to the full order solver used and it can be easily incorporated into existing numerical pipelines, from the reference CAD to the optimal shape.}
